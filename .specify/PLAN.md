# Spoke - Initial Plan (Spec-driven)

1. Create `.specify` artifacts (constitution, spec, plan, tasks).
2. Add instructions for contributors on how to use `specify-cli` locally or in CI.
3. Triage open issues into `TASKS.md` and tag owners.
4. Implement highest-priority task: secure wallet onboarding flow improvements.
5. Add unit tests for wallet and bridge connection logic; run in CI.
6. Iterate: refine spec and plan from contributor feedback.

Milestones
- M1: `.specify` added and documented (this commit).
- M2: Core tasks implemented and tests added.
- M3: CI runs `specify` steps and verifies mappings between tasks and code.
